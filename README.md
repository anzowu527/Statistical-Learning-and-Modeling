### Examining_Bird_Diversity 
- The goal of this project is to familierize with EDA, and explore the Bird Diversity data
- I focused on heterozygosity, to uncover patterns that shape our understanding of bird populations and their resilience
- Data Cleaning includes checking missing values, detecting outliers of different columns by various kind of plots, eliminating outliers by IQR - Data Exoloratory includes finding correlation between Heterozygosity and other variable. (Heterozygosity vs. categorical, Heterozygosity vs. numerical), and some more interesting findings
